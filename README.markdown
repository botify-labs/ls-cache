lscache
===============================
This is a simple library that emulates `memcache` functions using HTML5 `localStorage`, so that you can cache data on the client
and associate an expiration time with each piece of data. If the `localStorage` limit (~5MB) is exceeded, it tries to create space by removing the items that are closest to expiring anyway. If `localStorage` is not available at all in the browser, the library degrades by simply not caching and all cache requests return null.

Methods
-------

The library exposes methods: `set()`, `get()`, `remove()`, `flush()`, `createBucket()` and `keys()`.

* * *

### lscache.set
Stores the value in localStorage. Expires after specified number of minutes.
#### Arguments
1. `key` (**string**)
2. `value` (**Object**)
3. `time` (**number: optional**)

* * *

### lscache.get
Retrieves specified value from localStorage, if not expired.
#### Arguments
1. `key` (**string**)
#### Returns
**Object** : The stored value.

* * *

### lscache.keys
Gets list of all keys in bucket
#### Returns
**Array** : Key names

* * *

### lscache.remove
Removes a value from localStorage.
#### Arguments
1. `key` (**string**)

* * *

### lscache.flush
Removes all lscache items in current bucket from localStorage without affecting other data.

* * *

### lscache.createBucket
Creates a sub-bucket which is completely independent. However, its expirable items may be cleared to make room for more keys.
#### Arguments
1. `bucket` (**string**)

Usage
-------

The interface should be familiar to those of you who have used `memcache`, and should be easy to understand for those of you who haven't.

For example, you can store a string for 2 minutes using `lscache.set()`:

```js
lscache.set('greeting', 'Hello World!', 2);
```

You can then retrieve that string with `lscache.get()`:

```js
alert(lscache.get('greeting'));
```

You can remove that string from the cache entirely with `lscache.remove()`:

```js
lscache.remove('greeting');
```

You can remove all items from the cache entirely with `lscache.flush()`:

```js
lscache.flush();
```

The library also takes care of serializing objects, so you can store more complex data:

```js
lscache.set('data', {'name': 'Pamela', 'age': 26}, 2);
```

And then when you retrieve it, you will get it back as an object:

```js
alert(lscache.get('data').name);
```

If you have multiple instances of lscache running on the same domain, you can partition data in a certain bucket via:

```js
bucket = lscache.createBucket("something");
bucket.set('response', '...', 2);
lscache.set('path', '...', 2);
lscache.flush(); //only removes 'path' which was set in the root bucket, not the sub-bucket
```

Buckets are nestable:

```js
bucket = lscache.createBucket("firstlevel");
bucket2 = bucket.createBucket("secondlevel");
```

Browser Support
----------------

The `lscache` library should work in all browsers where `localStorage` is supported.
